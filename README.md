## Welcome to my Material-UI Playground

This is to demonstrate a function App built with material as a styling library.

I have learnt and implemented the following in this project

- Setting up and incorporating material-ui for any react project
- using different components available from material-ui
- customizing any material-ui component to own taste
- And many more tricks related to using material-ui and working with the a frontend React App

Please feel free to switch to other branches to see all my projects in material-ui
